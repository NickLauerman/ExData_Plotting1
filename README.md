ExData_Plotting1
================

Plotting Assignment 1 for Exploratory Data Analysis
-------------
For Coursera course.

The orginal README.md from the forked repo has been retitled **prompt.md** and contains the details for the assignemt.

There are 4 R scripts files for this assignment:

* `plot1.R`
* `plot2.R`
* `plot3.R`
* `plot4.R`

These scripts are run using the **source()** command for example `source(plot1.R)`

For the script to run the `exdata-data-household_power_consumption.zip` file must be in the 
same directory as the script file. If this file isn't present the script will
download it from `https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip`

Each script produces one graphics file in the PNG format with the same name but with 
the **png** extension. For example when **plot1.R** was run in the above example,
the script would have produced the **plot1.png** file same directory it is run from.

This repo has a figure directory which contains the graphics that are used in the 
**prompt.md** (the orginal **README.md**) file.
