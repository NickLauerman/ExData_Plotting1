Plotting Assignment 1 for Exploratory Data Analysis
-------------

For Coursera course.

THe orginal README.md from the forked repo has been retitled ***prompt.md*** and contains the details fo
the assignemt.

There are 4 R scripts files for this assignment:

* `plot1.R`
* `plot2.R`
* `plot3.R`
* `plot4.R`

These scripts are run using the *source()* command for example `source(plot1.R)`

For the script to run the `household_power_consumption.txt` file must be in the 
same directory as the script file.

Each script produces one graphics file in the PNG format with the same name but with 
the **png** extension. For example when *plot1.R* was run in the above example,
the script would have produced the *plot1.png* file same directory.

This repo has a figure directory which contains the graphics that are used in the 
*prompt.md* (the orginal *README.md*) file.
